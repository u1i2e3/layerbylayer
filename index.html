      <h2>WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?</h2>
      <p>
        AI can be thought of as a technological brain that learns through a process called machine learning, which involves using examples. AI systems are fed large amounts of information with the help of humans and can learn to distinguish between, for instance, a dog and a cat by analyzing many pictures of each. These images allow the AI to associate specific physical traits with each species.

        For example, an image of an animal with four legs could be either a dog or a cat. But if the animal is small, the possibilities narrow it might be a cat or a chihuahua. If the animal in the photo also has whiskers, it’s more likely to be a cat. This is how AI learns: by analyzing a wide variety of data to identify patterns and make sense of new information.

        A more user friendly way to describe AI is to think of it as a digital person that knows most of the information available on the internet.

      <h2>AI vs. Traditional Search</h2>
      <p>
        A big comparasion that could be easy to understand is Google and ChatGPT. Both of them can be described as search motors, but ChatGPT is by far the best choice
        a person has in order to look for information. AI has revolutionazed the world, since it's a technology that can pretty much help you to learn and do
        whatever you want whenever you want wherever you are since the only thing you need is internet and maybe a subscription in order to use an AI.

      <h2>Personalization</h2>
      <p>AI understands context and personal preferences, tailoring responses to each user. Unlike search engines that treat everyone the same, AI can learn and adapt to your needs.</p>

      <h2>Speed & Clarity</h2>
      <p>Need a quick summary or a deep explanation? AI gives clear, conversational answers and can handle follow-up questions — something traditional search can’t do efficiently.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Limitations & Realism</h2>
      <p>AI isn’t perfect — it can sometimes be outdated or make mistakes. However, it’s rapidly improving and often more helpful than sorting through SEO-optimized content.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>AI-powered tools represent the future of search. With faster, smarter, and more personalized results, it’s time to rethink how we find information online.</p>
