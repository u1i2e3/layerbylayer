      <h2>WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?</h2>
      <p>
        AI can be thought of as a technological brain that learns through a process called machine learning, which involves using examples. AI systems are fed large amounts of information with the help of humans and can learn to distinguish between, for instance, a dog and a cat by analyzing many pictures of each. These images allow the AI to associate specific physical traits with each species.

        For example, an image of an animal with four legs could be either a dog or a cat. But if the animal is small, the possibilities narrow it might be a cat or a chihuahua. If the animal in the photo also has whiskers, it’s more likely to be a cat. This is how AI learns: by analyzing a wide variety of data to identify patterns and make sense of new information.

        A more user friendly way to describe AI is to think of it as a digital person that knows most of the information available on the internet.

      <h2>AI vs. Traditional Search</h2>
      <p>
        A big comparasion that could be easy to understand is Google and ChatGPT. Both of them can be described as search motors, but ChatGPT is by far the best choice
        a person has in order to look for information. AI has revolutionazed the world, since it's a technology that can pretty much help you to learn and do
        whatever you want whenever you want wherever you are since the only thing you need is internet and maybe a subscription in order to use an AI. 

        The biggest thing between AI and a regular search engine is the time managment, which is the most valuable thing we have. The amount of information you can obtain
        using AI better for the time needed, since it provides everything you ask for in some seconds. Not only time but also the difficulty of finding information is nothing
        compared to regular search engines, since even a kid is capable of using AI and obtaining the information they want. Do you need a recipy? No problem just ask an AI for
        it and it will give it to you. You don't understand a step? It's ok, just ask again using depeer instrunctions which could be really hard using a regular search engine.
        The only problem is that AI acts by himself, which means those instructions of 1000 words which were created to help you mix three eggs might not be fully realistic or
        achievable since it will include information from sources around the internet which could not make sense somatimes or might even be wrong.

      <h2>Personalization</h2>
      <p>
        Personalization plays a major role in the world of AI, as an AI can be taught to perform specific tasks rather than trying to do everything. 
        For example, an AI that is trained exclusively in mathematics will likely provide better and more accurate mathematical answers compared to one trained on general topics. However, 
        the math-focused AI might be harder to understand, as it may use a more technical tone that reflects the data it was trained on.

      <h2>Limitations & Realism</h2>
      <p>
        AI is excellent when it comes to facts and well established information such as the power rule in calculus which is straightforward and technical, making it easier for a computer to process and understand. 
        However, a major challenge arises when dealing with reasoning and more emotional or subjective aspects. AI does not have personal experiences; it simply draws from the information available on the internet. 
        For example, an AI can be described as someone that writes notes for a class, but it doesn’t truly understand the content. Instead, it pulls from countless notes and resources to fill in the gaps in order
        to fully undestand the content of the notes. Meaning that information is needed in order to understand his own information, something that humans can deduce by simply looking at something.
        
        But what happens if there aren't enough notes or reliable information available? That’s where a major issue arises—AI hallucinations. This occurs when an AI generates incorrect or entirely made up information. 
        Hallucinations are one of the biggest problems with AI today, as the spread of false or fabricated facts can have serious consequences if not addressed properly.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        AI is one of the most important technologies developed in the last decade, as it can be used by anyone to learn something new. 
        It’s a tool that can help with almost anything. A great example of AI being used as a search engine is this website, which was entirely created with the help of ChatGPT. 
        I didn’t know how to build a website, but I wanted to make one. AI helped me understand how websites work, what is required to build one, and even provided the code needed to make it look professional.
        
        I believe this would have been nearly impossible to accomplish in just one day using only Google to find the information—yet I was able to achieve it with the help of AI.
