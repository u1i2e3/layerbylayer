      <h2>What is Additive Manufacturing?</h2>
      <p>
        Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is a process of creating physical objects
        from digital models by layering materials. Unlike traditional subtractive manufacturing,
        which removes material, additive methods build parts layer by layer, enabling complex geometries
        and efficient material usage.
