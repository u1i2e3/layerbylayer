      <h2>WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence mostly known as AI can be described in two different ways. It can be described using a technical reasoning or a more user friendly one. 
        AI are like technological brains that have been taught using machine learning, a type of learning which consist of examples. AI's are given tons of different information
        with the help of humans and AI would be capable to learn the difference between a dog or a cat by looking tons of pictures of each of them and providing a certain physical
        traits to each specie. For example and image with something that has four legs can be either both a cat or a dog, but what if it's small? The options become smaller, 
        now the photo provided can be either a cat or a chihuahua. But what if the thing in the photo has whiskers? Then it must be a cat. This is how an AI learns, by looking
        a variety of infortmation which can be used to understand. A more friendly response to the question of what is an AI is simple a digital person that knows most of the things 
        that is available on internet.
